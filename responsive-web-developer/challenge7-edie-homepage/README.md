## Overview

![screenshot](./demo-screenshot.gif)

Edie Homepage is a landing page ideal for development studio providing web services. It cover all important sections such as services, projects, clients, team etc.

I have tried to follow BEM (Block-Element-Modifier) naming convention for consistent and easy identification of elements.
